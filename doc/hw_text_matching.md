# Text Maching

Your task is to create a dialogue manager that talks about "technology".


## Task

* Download [`hw_text_matching.py`](../src/hw/hw_text_matching.py) and put it under the [`src/`](../src) directory.
* Choose 1 topic in technology (e.g., smartphone, laptop, AI) and create a dialogue manager for the topic.
* Your dialogue manager must: 
    * Make the minimum of 10 turns, where 1 turn = (user input, system output).
    * Not lengthen the conversation by repetitive and patterned interactions like consecutive turns of jokes or quiz questions.
    * Not generate (political, religious, sexual, violent) responses potentially offensive to certain groups.
    * Not reveal any author's identify.
* Your dialogue manager is encouraged to:
    * Derive more opinion-based than information-based conversations.
      > Information-based: What is your smartphone &rarr; iPhone.<br>
        Opinion-based: Why do you like iPhone &rarr; Because it integrates well with my mac.
    * Use ontology to make more intelligent conversations.   
* The following criteria will be used for the assessment: 
    * **Conversation Flow**: how smooth the conversation flows.
    * **Uniqueness**: how unique the user's experience is.
    * **Engagement**: how much depth the conversation gives.
    * **Case Coverage**: how many different cases are covered.
    * **Error handling**: how well unexpected inputs are handled.
* Write a report and save it as `hw1.pdf` that includes:
    * Names of the team members.
    * Diagrams of your dialogue flows.
    * Explanation of your approach.
