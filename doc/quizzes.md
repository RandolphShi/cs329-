# Quizzes

## Quiz 1

### Regular Expressions

* Create [`regular_expressions.py`](../src/regular_expressions.py) under the [`src/`](../src) directory and copy the contents.
* Complete the `turn_1b()` method such that it prompts to ask the kind of user's smartphone if it is not provided during `Turn 0`.
Once the information is retrieved, it should continue to `turn_1a()` as follows: 
  ```
  S: are you using a smartphone?
  U: yes
  S: what kind of smartphone do you have?
  U: samsung galaxy
  S: how long have you been using galaxy?
  ...
  ``` 
* Complete the `turn_3a()` method such that it properly estimates how old user's iPhone is given any version provided by the user.
Hint: use `res.d_iphone_v` defined in the main space.

### Submission

## Quiz 2

### Dialogue Management

reate [`state_machine.py`](../src/state_machine.py) under the [`src/`](../src) directory and copy the contents from the class source.

#### Task 1 

Set up the appropriate transitions such that the DialogueFlow can recognize `snake`, `lizard`, `turtle`, and `alligator` as `reptile`,
similar to how it recognizes `mammal` and `bird` already.
```
(System) Enter an animal:
(User) snake
(System) snake is a reptile, enter another animal: 
...
```

#### Task 2 

Set up the appropriate transitions using an ONTOLOGY reference such that the DialogueFlow can recognize `frog` and `salamander` as `amphibian`.

You must fill in the `ont_dict` variable with the `amphibian` ontology and use this ontology in the Natex expression you create for this case.
```
(System) Enter an animal:
(User) frog
(System) frog is an amphibian, enter another animal: 
...
```   

#### Task 3 

Modify each of the user transitions from `State.PROMPT` (including any you added for Tasks 1 and 2) such that the transition matches as long as the user says at least one of the specified words.

In other words, if the user says more than just the specified words, the transition should still match. (This isn't currently true, test and see for yourself!)

Here is an example:
```
(System) Enter an animal:
(User) what about frog
(System) frog is a reptile, enter another animal: 
(User) hmm cat i guess
(System) cat is a mammal, enter another animal:
(User) a parrot
(System) parrot is a bird, enter another animal:
...
```

* Complete the `antonyms()` method that takes a word and an optional POS tag, and returns the list of antonyms of the word.
* Complete the `lch_paths()` method that takes two words (not sense IDs), and returns the list of Synset list where each Synset list shows the path from every lowest common hypernym of the two words to its root.
